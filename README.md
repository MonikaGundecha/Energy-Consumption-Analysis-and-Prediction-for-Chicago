# Energy-Consumption-Analysis-and-Prediction-for-Chicago

In this project, analysis was conducted on Chicago's 2010 energy usage data, processing over 100,000 records with 73 variables using Apache Spark and PySpark for efficient big data handling. Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) were performed to uncover energy consumption patterns, revealing that the Loop, Near North Side, and Near West Side areas had the highest electrical usage, primarily driven by commercial properties. Interactive Power BI dashboards were created to visualize electrical and thermal energy consumption trends across community areas, building types, and age groups, highlighting that buildings aged 50-70 years exhibited higher thermal energy consumption. Furthermore, Random Forest and Gradient Boosted Tree classifiers were developed and compared to predict high energy consumption buildings, achieving an accuracy of 92.36% and providing actionable insights for targeted energy efficiency initiatives.
